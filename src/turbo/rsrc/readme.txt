I) What's it ?
--------------

TURBO DC-TOOL GUI is a small app which allows upload file to the Dreamcast while using 
right-click context menu on a file. 

Much code comes from the DC-TOOL GUI app, the result that this application is rather stable.

This application isn't for the development. Prefer original DC-TOOL GUI if you wish to 
make some. This application is quickly (a right-click then Upload and it's finished).

You must have the BINCHECK.DLL and the DCTOOL.DLL (from DC-TOOL GUI) in the same dir of the app.

II) Use
-------

Double-Click on the app. If you want to add a context menu to the ELF and BIN files, go to
Options and Select 'Include this app in the context menu'.

Don't move the EXE after doing this !

The use is very simple.

III) Credits
------------

Thanks to all DC communauty, ADK Napalm for DC-TOOL and Phidels.Com.
