# DC-TOOL GUI

**DC-TOOL GUI** is a graphical user-interface (GUI) for **DC-TOOL**, very easy
and nice to use. **DC-TOOL** is a set of programs made to send and receive data
from your **Sega Dreamcast** system. The classic use of this tool is to send
programs to the **Dreamcast** in order to run and debug them.

**DC-TOOL** was made by **ADK/Napalm** and now it's officially part of [KallistiOS](https://github.com/KallistiOS).

The **DC-TOOL GUI** program exists in 3 versions:
* `v2.0`: A lightweight version of the GUI, released on **July 14, 2004**.
* `v3.0-beta1`: A more complete and complex version of the GUI, released on **October 2, 2005**. It was never finished.
